/// appends one to a file they can send instead: a session header, a thin trail
/// of what they were doing, and every error the app managed to catch.
///
/// Three rules shape it:
///
/// * **Append immediately, never buffer.** The lines worth having are the ones
///   written just before a crash, and a buffer is exactly what a crash
///   discards. Writes are serialised through [_pending] so ordering holds.
/// * **Never throw.** A logger that can break the app is worse than no logger,
///   so every failure here is swallowed. There is nowhere to report it *to*.
/// * **Ids, never text the user typed.** Breadcrumbs carry record ids, not
///   plant, part or workcenter names, so the file stays something a colleague
///   can forward without wondering what else is in it.
